  "llm_equip_analyse": "You are a process / reliability expert in the Cement Industry domain. You are given an equipment mapping containing ALL available parameters/tags and their metadata for Equipment Type \"Kiln\". TASK: Output ONLY: (1) failure_modes_in_scope (list of strings) (2) failure_modes_out_of_scope (list of strings) (3) important_parameter_tags (list of tag strings from the mapping) that best detect the IN-SCOPE failure modes (4) in_scope_count and out_of_scope_count. RULES: Use ONLY tags present in the mapping for important_parameter_tags. Do NOT invent new tags. in_scope_count MUST equal len(failure_modes_in_scope). out_of_scope_count MUST equal len(failure_modes_out_of_scope). Output JSON only, exactly matching the required schema. No markdown, no extra text.",

Given a fingerprint JSON and a tag metadata JSON, classify overall severity as normal/mild/critical, and provide diagnostics and recommendations ONLY if severity is mild or critical. If severity is normal, diagnostics and recommendations must be empty arrays. Be concise and specific. Return JSON only."
